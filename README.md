# Readme - File Monitoring and Backup

This Python script monitors specific files in a folder, checks if they have been modified, and makes a backup of the modified files.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

## Usage

1. Replace "folder/to/verification" in the script with the actual folder path that contains the files you want to monitor.
2. Run the Python script (filename.py) to start the file monitoring process.
3. The script will check the specified folder for Python files (files with the ".py" extension).
4. If any of the Python files have been modified since the last check or if they are new files, they will be copied to the "save_folder" directory.
5. The script will record the file sizes in a JSON file (data_file.json) for future comparisons.

## How It Works

1. The script uses the subprocess module to run a command that finds all Python files in the specified folder.
2. It checks the file sizes of the found files and compares them with the recorded sizes in the data_file.json.
3. If any file has been modified or is new, it copies the file to the "save_folder" directory.
4. The script keeps track of the file sizes in the data_file.json to determine if there have been any changes in subsequent checks.

## Disclaimer
